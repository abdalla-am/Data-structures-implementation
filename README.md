# **ðŸ‘‰Stack**

## **What is Stack?**
#### The stack data structure is a linear data structure that accompanies a principle known as **LIFO (Last In First Out)** . Real-life examples of a stack are a deck of cards, piles of books, piles of money, and many more.

## **When we use Stack ?**
#### Stack data structures are useful when the order of actions is important. They ensure that a system does not move onto a new action before completing those before. Here are some common examples where a stack is used: 
 - Reversing
 - Undo/redo operations
 - Backtracking

## **What is the complexity when using Stack ?**
#### For the array-based implementation of a stack, the push and pop operations take constant time, i.e. `O(1)`.

## **Implementation of Stack can be done by using :**
- Array (used in the repo)
- Linked list

## **There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack :**
### - lenght : return number of elements in the stack
### - Push : Add an element to the top of a stack
### - Pop : Remove an element from the top of a stack
### - Top : return the top element
### - Empty : Check if the stack is empty
### - Expand : increase the size of the array if Stack is full
