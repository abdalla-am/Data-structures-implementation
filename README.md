## **Why we need Data structure ?ü§î**
### Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways. Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.

## There are two categories of data structures :
   - Linear data structures
      - Stack
      - Queue
      - Lists
   - Non linear data structures
      - Trees
      - Graphs
<br>
  üìåBoth will be discussed

## **List Of Implemented Algorithms:**
- [x] Stack
- [x] Queue
- [x] Array list
- [x] Linked list
- [x] Binary search tree

# **1Ô∏è‚É£Stack**

## **What is Stack ?**
#### The stack data structure is a linear data structure that accompanies a principle known as **LIFO (Last In First Out)** . Real-life examples of a stack are a deck of cards, piles of books, piles of money, and many more.

## **When we use Stack ?**
#### Stack data structures are useful when the order of actions is important. They ensure that a system does not move onto a new action before completing those before. Here are some common examples where a stack is used: 
 - Reversing
 - Undo/redo operations
 - Backtracking

## **What is the complexity when using Stack ?**
#### For the array-based implementation of a stack, the push and pop operations take constant time, i.e. `O(1)` , and it requires `O(N)` operations to display all elements of the Stack as we need to pop all elements in the stack .

## **Implementation of Stack can be done by using :**
- Array (used in the repo)
- Linked list

## **Operations need to be implemented to create a stack :**
 - lenght : return number of elements in the stack
 - Push : Add an element to the top of a stack
 - Pop : Remove an element from the top of a stack
 - Top : return the top element
 - Empty : Check if the stack is empty
 - Expand : increase the size of the array if Stack is full

## **STL used for Stack**
```bash
Stack <int> S;
S.empty();           //return weather stack is empty or not
S.push(value);       //Add an element to the top of a stack
S.pop();             //Remove an element from the top of a stack
S.size();            //return the size of the stack
S.top();             //return the top element
```

# **2Ô∏è‚É£Queue**

## **What is Queue ?**
#### A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

![picture alt](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20221213113312/Queue-Data-Structures.png "Queue data structure")

## **When we use Queue ?**
#### The basic appeal of a queue is that is a data structure that guarantees order and it guarantees a fair order. The first element that entered the Queue is the first element to be dequeued .

## **What is the complexity when using Queue ?**
#### For the array-based implementation of a Queue , the enqueue and dequeue operations take constant time, i.e. `O(1)` . 

## **Implementation of Queue can be done by using :**
- Array (used in the repo)
- Linked list
- Stack

 ## **Operations need to be implemented to create a queue :**
 - enqueue : Add element to the back
 - dequeue : Remove an element from the front 
 - frontf : Return the front element
 - backf : Return the back element
 - lenthf : return no. of elements in the queue
 - isempty : return true if queue is empty
 - isfull : return true if the queue is full
 
 ## **STL used for Queue**


| ***queue<int> Q;*** | ***deque<int> Q;*** | ***Functionality*** |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Q.empty(); | Q.empty(); | Returns whether the queue is empty |
| Q.pop(); | Q.pop_front(); | Removes the element at the front of the queue |
| Q.push(); | Q.push_back(); | Adds an element to the end of the queue |
| Q.size(); | Q.size(); | Returns the number of elements in the queue |
| Q.front(); | Q.front(); | Returns the front element |
| Q.back();  | Q.back(); | Returns the back element. |
| --  | Q.pop_back(); | Remove last element |
| --  | Q.push_front(); | Adds an element at the start |

# **3Ô∏è‚É£Array list**

## **What is Arraylist ?**
####  They are resizable arrays, also called dynamic arrays, are data structures that store elements in sequential order and whose size can be increased or decreased by adding or removing elements.

![picture alt](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/0*5w9-ibvGwT1EpeH9.png "Arraylist data structure")

## **When we use Array list ?**
#### ArrayLists are a type of collection that can be used to store various types of data. This means two different classes like string and integer can be stored together in a single collection. There are both advantages and disadvantages to ArrayLists.

## **What is the complexity when using arraylist ?**
| ***Operation*** | ***Time complexity*** |
| --- | --- |
| Insert at last index | `O(1)` |
| Insert at given index | `O(N)` |
| Search by value | `O(N)` |
| Get by index | `O(1)` |
| Remove by value| `O(N)` |
| Remove by index | `O(N)` |

 ## **Operations need to be implemented to create a queue :**
 - Length : returns number of elements
 - Append : Add an element at the end
 - Expand : insert an element at last position in the arraylist
 - At : returns the element at specified position
 - DeleteAt : remove an element at specific position
 - InsertAt : add an element at specific position

## **STL used for Arraylist**
```bash
vector<int> V;  
V.at(index);            //returns the element at the specified position.
V.capacity();           //returns the size of the storage space currently allocated for the vector.
V.clear();              //Removes all elements from the vector
V.empty();              //Returns whether the vector is empty.
V.push_back(value);     //Adds a new element at the end of the vector (increases size).
V.pop_back();           //Removes the last element in the vector (reduces size);
V.size();               // Returns the number of elements in the vector.
```

# **4Ô∏è‚É£Linkedlist**

## **What is Linkedlist ?**
#### A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers

![picture alt](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220712172013/Singlelinkedlist.png "Linkedlist data structure")

## **When we use Linkedlist ?**
- Linked Lists are used when the number of elements is not known in advance i.e. size is not known as linked lists support dynamic memory allocation.
- Linked Lists can be used for the manipulation of polynomials.
- Linked lists are used for performing arithmetic operations on long integers.

## There are four key types of linked lists:
- Singly linked lists (our focus)
- Doubly linked lists
- Circular linked lists
- Circular doubly linked lists

## **What is the complexity when using Linkedlist ?**
| ***Operation*** | ***Time complexity*** |
| --- | --- |
| Insert at last index | `O(1)` |
| Insert at given index | `O(N)` |
| Search by value | `O(N)` |
| Get by index | `O(N)` |
| Remove by value| `O(N)` |
| Remove by index | `O(N)` |

## **Operations need to be implemented to create a Singly Linkedlist :**
- Length : returns number of elements.
- Append : Add an element at the end.
- At : returns the element at specified position.
- InsertAt : add an element at specific position.
- DeleteAt : remove an element at specific position

## **STL used for Linkedlist**
```bash
list<int> L;                
L.push_back(value);         //Inserts a new element at the end of the list.
L.pop_back();               //Delete the element at the end of the list.
L.push_front();             //Inserts a new element at the beginning of the list.
L.pop_front();              //Delete the element at the beginning of the list.
L.empty()                   //Returns whether the list container is empty .
L.clear()                   //Removes all elements from the list container.
```
